# Shell scripts

This repository contains some scripts I like to have available from anywhere

## stdlib.sh

Contains handy functions for bash scripting, such as:
- `min`: get the smallest of 2 numbers
- `max`: get the largest of 2 numbers
- `in_array`: checks if a value is in an array
- `in_map`: checks if a key is present in an associative array
- `argparse`: parse command-line arguments. Inspired by `fish`'s argparse command
